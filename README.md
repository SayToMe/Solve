# Solve

This library is an educational presentation of language Prolog in a sweet syntax with strong typing. This could be used to interpret and migrate existing Prolog code-base and just by itself as a Prolog framework. Current Prolog features implemented:
* Basic rules
* Complex rules
* Multiple results
* Unification with different parameter/argument variable names
* Strings and lists
* Custom calls
* Temporary variables
* Recursive calls
* Calc calls by structs
* Lazy execution
* Cut operator
* Not operator
* Prolog code parser

Features are going to be implemented:
* Standard library
* Wild card

TODO:
Switch to .NET Core
Unification shouldn't be one-directed

## Requirements

Solve requires a local git installation. You can download git from [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
