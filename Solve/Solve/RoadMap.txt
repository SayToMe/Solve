To implement:
* Probably AST could be wrong way to resolve recursive and subcall rules
* Maybe we should have some sort of knowledge base
* Custom calls
* Strings and lists

Check on:
* Implementation of facts

Currently support:
* Basic rules
* Complex rules
* Multiple results
* Unification with different parameter/argument variable names
