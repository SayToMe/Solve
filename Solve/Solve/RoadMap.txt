To implement:
* Structs
* Custom calls should accept variables to accept structs/booleans and others
* Cuts
* Not expression
* Standard library

Check on:
* Do we need not executed expression?
* Return values from complex expressions like (and(or(and)))

Currently support:
* Basic rules
* Complex rules
* Multiple results
* Unification with different parameter/argument variable names
* Strings and lists
* Custom calls
* Temporary variables
