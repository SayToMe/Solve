To implement:
* Probably AST could be wrong way to resolve recursive and subcall rules
* Maybe we should have some sort of knowledge base
* Custom calls

Check on:
* Implementation of facts
* Unify with variables with names different from parameters

Currently support:
* Basic rules
* Complex rules
* Multiple results
